What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You allow git to keep track of the changes you make to files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is in between the working directory and the repostitory. It is a place where files are placed before they are commited to version control. Files can be removed from the staging area with the git reset <file> command. The staging area allows you to group files together to be commited based on logical changeds to them, based on informatin changed, etc.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You only add a file to the staging area after a logical change to ensure that you can always go back to a previous file in case of a bug introduction.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Testing of adding new features, new ideas not ready to be incorporated into main file. Branches help by providing a new file branch where ideas can be tested without altering the functionality of the original files.
