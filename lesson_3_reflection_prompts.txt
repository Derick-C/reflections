When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  In cases where you don't have access to the computer where you usually work. To share the commits to the workflow with other team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	There might be some changes that produce conflict with some of the things that you are developing. Is better to have control over when updates are done both when one performs a pull or push.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Branches: Local directory or local to the repository on GitHub.
	Clones: Copy from GitHub Repository to local directory.
	Fork: Copy from GitHub Repository to My GitHub Repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It can help us to find out if we have already push the changes to the remote, by running git status. It also gives us a way to keep track of changes while offline, before any new changes from any contributor.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	You can other applications that allows different team members to have access and edit the same documents. This apps also provide the ability to write comments and notes to inform the rest of the team about your changes. Some of the advantages are that many of these apps provide a more friendly user interface that makes it easier to navigate and to share points of conflicts while working in a project.
	Git and GitHub provide perhaps a better way to deal with changes from different sources without worrying to make actual changes until you have all agreed to.
